# miscarriage prediction model
this python code was used to predict if a miscarriage could happen to a pregnant female at earlly stages.
<p>to build this model we used 6 classifiers RF, DT, KNN, SVM, LR and XGboost.</p>
<p>the dataset in this project is from an open source dataset, the dataset was severely imbalanced so i applied some balancing techniques to get more accurate results</p>
